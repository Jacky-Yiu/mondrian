The GC metrics are collected by picard's CollectGcMetrics. We run the program with default settings and generate the following table.


|Column name | Description|
|------------|------------|
| cell_id | |
| 0 | NORMALIZED_COVERAGE where GC = 0 |
| 1 | NORMALIZED_COVERAGE where GC = 1 |
| 2 | NORMALIZED_COVERAGE where GC = 2 |
| 3 | NORMALIZED_COVERAGE where GC = 3 |
|...| |
| 99 | NORMALIZED_COVERAGE where GC = 99 |
| 100 | NORMALIZED_COVERAGE where GC = 100 |
